            <p>Descripion: GMAPS is a light weight way to add a map to your webpage. It stuffs a google map into the page that you can navigate, move and zoom with. Street view even works. This is a basic example that does not include right click options or the abiltity to use directions. Simple location finding, this demonstration is preset with the Madison College location. Basically what happens is that a "window" is placed on the page that loads the result of a google maps search for a specific location. It makes it look like the google map page is visible behind your page. </p>
